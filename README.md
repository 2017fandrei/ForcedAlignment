# ForcedAlignment

ForcedAlignment is a graphical tool to automatically synchronize audio and text.
Contact: fandrei2000@yahoo.com

# Goal
 ForcedAlignment generates a html file with an audio player and a list, from a text file and an audio file. The text and audio file must match. The text is highlighted as the speech progresses. The text is split by delimiters like .(full stop) !(exclamation mark) ?(question mark) ,(comma) ;(semicolon)  in units for easy following. By clicking on such an unit the reading begins at that moment. A text file and an audio file exists as samples. The generated temp_csv_file.csv  and temp_txt_file.txt can be deleted.
